## Current Configuration

### Dev Environment

Region: eu-west-2
Owner: hari.chintala@isaggio.com
Status: ✅ Configured
```

### Test Environment
```
Account ID: TBD (update config/test.tfvars when ready)
Region: eu-west-2
Owner: hari.chintala@isaggio.com
Status: ⏳ Pending
```

### Production Environment
```
Account ID: TBD (update config/prod.tfvars when ready)
Region: eu-west-2
Owner: hari.chintala@isaggio.com
Status: ⏳ Pending
```

## Verification

Run the verification script to check everything:

```bash
cd /Users/hari.chintala/dataworks-infrastructure

# Source credentials first
source ./scripts/setup-aws-credentials.sh

# Run verification
./scripts/verify-setup.sh
```

Expected output:
```
✓ AWS CLI installed
✓ Terraform installed
✓ AWS credentials configured
✓ AWS credentials valid
  Account: 865517490483
  ✓ Matches dev account
✓ All required files present
✓ Scripts executable
✓ Git repository initialized
✓ Credentials are git-ignored
✓ Account ID configured

✓ All checks passed!

You're ready to bootstrap:
  source ./scripts/setup-aws-credentials.sh
  make bootstrap-dev
```

## What This Means

### Account ID Usage

The account ID is used for:
1. **Validation**: Ensures you're deploying to the correct AWS account
2. **Resource naming**: Can be used in resource names if needed
3. **IAM policies**: Can be used in ARNs for cross-account access
4. **Documentation**: Clear record of which account each environment uses

### Flexibility

The configuration now supports:
- **Explicit account ID**: Specified in tfvars (dev)
- **Auto-detect**: Falls back to detected account if not specified (test/prod)
- **Multi-account**: Easy to configure different accounts per environment

## Next Steps

### For Dev Environment (Ready Now!)

```bash
# 1. Source credentials
source ./scripts/setup-aws-credentials.sh

# 2. Verify setup
./scripts/verify-setup.sh

# 3. Bootstrap backend
make bootstrap-dev

# 4. Plan infrastructure
make plan-dev

# 5. Apply infrastructure
make apply-dev
```

### For Test/Prod Environments (When Ready)

When you have test and prod account IDs:

1. Update the config files:
   ```bash
   # Edit config/test.tfvars
   account_id = "YOUR_TEST_ACCOUNT_ID"
   
   # Edit config/prod.tfvars
   account_id = "YOUR_PROD_ACCOUNT_ID"
   ```

2. Update credentials for that account
3. Run bootstrap and deploy

## Benefits

✅ **Security**: Account ID validation prevents deploying to wrong account  
✅ **Clarity**: Clear documentation of which account is which  
✅ **Flexibility**: Supports single or multi-account setups  
✅ **Automation**: Can be used in CI/CD pipelines  
✅ **Audit**: Easy to track which resources are in which account
