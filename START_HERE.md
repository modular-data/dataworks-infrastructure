## 🚀 WHAT TO DO RIGHT NOW

### ⭐ Step 1: Test Credentials (2 minutes)

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
cd /Users/hari.chintala/dataworks-infrastructure

# Source your credentials
source ./scripts/setup-aws-credentials.sh

# You should see:
# ✓ AWS credentials configured
# ✓ Region: eu-west-2
# ✓ User: hari.chintala@isaggio.com
# ✓ AWS credentials are valid!
```

**Expected output:**
```
{
    "UserId": "...",
    "Account": "...",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::...:user/..."
}
```

✅ **SUCCESS:** Move to Step 2  
❌ **FAILED:** Check AWS CLI is installed: `aws --version`

---

### ⭐ Step 2: Bootstrap Dev Environment (5 minutes)

```bash
# Make sure credentials are sourced (from Step 1)
source ./scripts/setup-aws-credentials.sh

# Bootstrap dev backend
make bootstrap-dev

# OR manually:
./scripts/bootstrap-backend.sh dev
```

**What this does:**
- Creates S3 bucket: `dataworks-terraform-state-dev`
- Creates DynamoDB table: `dataworks-terraform-state-dev`
- Configures encryption and versioning

**Expected output:**
```
✓ S3 bucket created successfully
✓ DynamoDB table created successfully
Bootstrap complete!
```

✅ **SUCCESS:** Move to Step 3  
❌ **FAILED:** Check error message and AWS permissions

---

### ⭐ Step 3: Test Terraform Plan (3 minutes)

```bash
# Make sure credentials are sourced
source ./scripts/setup-aws-credentials.sh

# Plan infrastructure
make plan-dev
```

**What this does:**
- Initializes Terraform
- Shows what will be created (1 KMS key + 13 S3 buckets)

**Expected output:**
```
Plan: 14 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
```

✅ **SUCCESS:** Ready to apply!  
❌ **FAILED:** Check error messages

---

### ⭐ Step 4: Apply Infrastructure (OPTIONAL - 5 minutes)

**⚠️ WARNING:** This will create real AWS resources (costs money, but minimal)

```bash
# Make sure credentials are sourced
source ./scripts/setup-aws-credentials.sh

# Apply infrastructure
make apply-dev

# Type 'yes' when prompted
```

**What this creates:**
- 1 KMS key
- 13 S3 buckets (encrypted, private, tagged)

**Expected output:**
```
Apply complete! Resources: 14 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

---

## 📋 Quick Command Reference

**Always run this first in every new terminal:**
```bash
source ./scripts/setup-aws-credentials.sh
```

**Then run any of these:**
```bash
make bootstrap-dev      # Create backend (one-time)
make plan-dev          # See what will change
make apply-dev         # Create infrastructure
make fmt               # Format code
aws s3 ls              # List S3 buckets
```

---

## 🔍 Verification Commands

**Check backend exists:**
```bash
aws s3 ls s3://dataworks-terraform-state-dev
aws dynamodb describe-table --table-name dataworks-terraform-state-dev
```

**Check infrastructure created:**
```bash
aws s3 ls | grep dataworks
aws kms list-keys
```

**Check Terraform state:**
```bash
cd /Users/hari.chintala/dataworks-infrastructure
make init-dev
terraform state list
```

## 🎯 Your Exact Commands (Copy & Paste)

### Complete First-Time Setup

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /Users/hari.chintala/dataworks-infrastructure

# Source credentials
source ./scripts/setup-aws-credentials.sh

# Bootstrap backend
make bootstrap-dev

# Plan infrastructure
make plan-dev

# Review the plan output...

# If everything looks good, apply
make apply-dev
```

### Daily Development Workflow

```bash
# Start of day
cd /Users/hari.chintala/dataworks-infrastructure
source ./scripts/setup-aws-credentials.sh

# Make changes to .tf files...

# Format code
make fmt

# Plan changes
make plan-dev

# Apply changes
make apply-dev
```

## ⏱️ Time Estimates

- **Step 1** (Test credentials): 2 minutes
- **Step 2** (Bootstrap): 5 minutes
- **Step 3** (Plan): 3 minutes
- **Step 4** (Apply): 5 minutes

**Total time: ~15 minutes** to have fully working infrastructure! 🎉

## 🐛 Common Issues

### Issue: "command not found: source"
**Solution:** Use bash or zsh, not sh
```bash
bash
source ./scripts/setup-aws-credentials.sh
```

### Issue: Credentials not working in new terminal
**Solution:** Must source in each new terminal
```bash
source ./scripts/setup-aws-credentials.sh
```

### Issue: "bucket already exists"
**Solution:** Backend was already created, that's OK! Continue to next step.

### Issue: "access denied"
**Solution:** Re-source credentials
```bash
source ./scripts/setup-aws-credentials.sh
```

---

## ✅ Success Indicators

You'll know it worked when:

1. ✅ `aws sts get-caller-identity` shows your account
2. ✅ Bootstrap creates S3 bucket and DynamoDB table
3. ✅ `make plan-dev` shows "Plan: 14 to add"
4. ✅ `make apply-dev` creates resources successfully
5. ✅ `aws s3 ls | grep dataworks` shows your buckets
